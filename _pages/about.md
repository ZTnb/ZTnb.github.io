I'm a second year postgraduate student from [Institute of Medical Technology](https://imt.bjmu.edu.cn/), [Peking University Health Science Center](https://www.bjmu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes radiation oncology, radiotherapt treatment planning, robustness evaluation and optimization.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Hao Wu and [Dr. Ruoxi Wang](mailto:rwang@bjmu.edu.cn) from department of radiation oncology, Beijing Caner Hospital.
